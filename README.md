# Project Name: Cryptocurrency Viewer

---

## Introduction

Welcome to Cryptocurrency Viewer, a React Native application that allows users to view cryptocurrency prices. This project utilizes API integration and Redux for state management.

---

## Purpose

I noticed that Apple has a nice app for viewing stock prices, and I thought why not make a similar one for viewing cryptocurrency. This project aims to provide users with a convenient way to track cryptocurrency prices in real-time.
